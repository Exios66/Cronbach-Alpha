# Cronbach-Alpha

 RUST - Psychometrics
I'll help you create a comprehensive README.md file for your Cronbach-Alpha project. Here's a detailed version:

## Overview

Cronbach's Alpha is one of the most widely used measures of reliability in psychometric assessment and research. This implementation provides a robust and efficient way to calculate the coefficient using Rust's performance capabilities.

## Features

- Fast and efficient Cronbach's Alpha calculation
- Support for multiple data formats
- Handles missing values
- Statistical validation checks
- Clear error handling and reporting

## Installation

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
cronbach-alpha = "0.1.0"
```

## Usage

```rust
use cronbach_alpha::calculate_alpha;

fn main() {
    // Example data matrix (items x participants)
    let data = vec![
        vec![5, 4, 3, 2],
        vec![4, 3, 2, 1],
        vec![5, 4, 3, 2],
    ];

    match calculate_alpha(&data) {
        Ok(alpha) => println!("Cronbach's Alpha: {:.3}", alpha),
        Err(e) => eprintln!("Error: {}", e),
    }
}
```

## Mathematical Background

Cronbach's Alpha (α) is calculated using the formula:

α = (k / (k-1)) * (1 - Σσᵢ² / σₜ²)

Where:

- k is the number of items
- σᵢ² is the variance of each item
- σₜ² is the variance of the total score

## Requirements

- Rust 1.56.0 or higher
- Standard statistical libraries
